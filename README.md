## 🔍 Project Phases

### ✅ Phase 1 — Data Loading & Cleaning
- Loaded all 9 CSV files into Pandas DataFrames
- Checked and handled null values across all tables
- Parsed 5 datetime columns and engineered features:
  `delivery_days`, `year`, `month`, `quarter`, `day_of_week`
- Merged all 9 tables into one **master dataframe** (112,650 rows × 40+ columns)
- Saved `olist_master.csv` and `olist_delivered.csv` for downstream analysis

### ✅ Phase 2 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Generated 11 charts uncovering key business insights:

| # | Chart | Key Finding |
|---|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Monthly Revenue Trend | Peak revenue in Nov 2017 (Black Friday effect) |
| 2 | Top 10 Categories | Health & Beauty leads in total revenue |
| 3 | Revenue by State | São Paulo (SP) contributes ~42% of all revenue |
| 4 | Order Status | 97%+ orders successfully delivered |
| 5 | Delivery Time | Average delivery = ~12 days; high variance |
| 6 | Review Scores | 57% customers give 5-star ratings |

## 💡 Business Recommendations

Based on the analysis so far:

1. **Focus marketing on São Paulo & Rio de Janeiro** — these two states contribute over 55% of total revenue. Targeted campaigns here will have maximum ROI.

2. **Improve delivery in Northern states** — AM, RR, and PA have late delivery rates above 20%, which directly correlates with lower review scores. Partnering with regional logistics providers could improve satisfaction scores by an estimated 15–20%.

3. **Double down on Health & Beauty category** — highest revenue category with strong repeat purchase potential. Bundle deals and loyalty offers here would increase Customer Lifetime Value.

4. **Reduce Monday–Wednesday cart abandonment** — peak order days suggest customers browse on weekends but buy on weekdays. Flash sales on Sunday evenings could convert more browsers into buyers.
